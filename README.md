IAM PARTICULARLY VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT QUANTITATIVE FINANCE AND WAS HEAVILY INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING MODELS FOR AFRICAN FINANCIAL MARKETS
A KEY PROBLEM THOUGH IS UNRELIABLE DATA , YOU CAN'T JUST YFINANCE YOUR WAY IN😂. CURRENTLY I HAVE DATA PIPELINES THAT SCRAPE API END POINTS AND SOME SCRAPE HTML FILES TO OBTAIN DATA, SO ALOT OF IT CURRENTLY IS DATA ACQUISTION, CLEANING AND STORING TO A DATABASE
SINCE THE DATABASE IM CURRENTLY USING IS SQLITE3 ITS BASICALLY USELESS FOR ANYONE WHO TAKES MY PIPELINES, UNLESS OFCOURSE THEY REPLACE THE END DATABASE BUT SOON ILL SHIT TO A MYSQL SERVER AND THE SCRIPTS SHALL BE USABLE FOR ANYONE WHO COPIES THE REPO.
THE NSE DATAPIPELINE THOUGH IS NOT REPLICABLE SINCE THERE IS A MANUAL PROCESS THAT I CAN'T AUTOMATE.
THE OTHER PIPELINES THOUGH ARE FUNCTIIONAL.
I PLAN TO ADD DATA FROM
1. FUNDAMENTAL DATA FROM ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY REPORTS PIPELINES
2. MACRO DATA STATISTICS PIPELINES
3. CORPORATE ACTIONS PIPELINES
4. ANALYSES AND MODELS IN THE FUTURE.

THOUGH REALISTICALLY THE PIPELINES WOULD HAVE SO MUCH MANUAL PROCESSES AND SO IT WOULD BE THE DATA MOSTLY VALUABLE.
I'VE ALREADY MIGRATED TO POSTGRES SO I CAN CONTINUE DATA COLLECTING AND BUILDING PIPELINES
